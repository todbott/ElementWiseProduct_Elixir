# ElementWiseProduct_Elixir

I was fortunate enough to take a coding test given by RESTAR, a Japanese company that deals with real-estate related information, in early 2022.  

The coding test itself had a few theory/opinion questions, and one crazy question about matrix multiplication. ⚠️ IN ELIXIR! ⚠️

I'd never worked with Elixir before (nor even heard about it).  Also, I had zero functional programming background, so it was a great learning experience for me!  I actually devoted about 5 days to writing the 17 lines of code here in this repo.  I even dropped about $200 USD on an Elixir tutor.  Probably the most difficult (and expensive) coding challenge I'd ever received.

Any word from RESTAR? Nope.  Just the same, I was happy to learn about functional programming, and be able to say I have (at least just a little) Elixir experience.

Here's the outputs they were looking for, by the way:
```
Test.element_wise_product([1, 2], [3, 4]) => [3, 8]
Test.element_wise_product([[1, [[2]]]], [[3, [[4]]]]) => [[3, [[8]]]]
Test.element_wise_product([[1, 2]], [3, 4]) => raise custom error
```
